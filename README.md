##Contributing
The project is really small for now and nothing valuable hasn't been done yet, 
so it is recommended to wait for some time before contributing.
Anyway, if you really would like to contribute, please follow these simple guidelines:

* Keep the code clean and readable, yet preserving common coding style. Particularly,
use the same indentation as you see everywhere in the code:
    ```c++
    void foo() {
        if() {

        }
        else {

        }
        while() {

        }
        // and so on...
    }
    ```
* Source files have `.cpp` extension and are cept in `src/` directory.
* Include files have `.hpp` extension and are cept in `inc/` directory.
* Give your pull requests meaningful names and detailed description.
